# Creating a Workspace in Terraform Cloud

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will be creating a workspace in Terraform Cloud. This is a fundamental step in setting up your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices. Terraform Cloud is a hosted service that helps you manage and automate your infrastructure, making it easy to create, use, and share infrastructure safely and efficiently. This guide will walk you through the process step by step, from creating an account to integrating your workspace via the CLI method. Let's get started!

## Desired Outcome

If you wish to give it a shot before looking into the detailed step-by-step and the solution videos, here is an overview of what the created solution should deploy:

1. Create an account and login to Terraform Cloud.
2. Create a new organization and workspace integrated via the CLI method.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create an account and login into Terraform Cloud. The login process should be fairly straightforward, and, if asked, I would recommend using GitHub to make the VCS integration easier later on.
2. Create an organization following the steps specified in the UI.
3. Click on “Create Workspace” in the Dashboard page.
4. Select “CLI-Driven Workflow” and provide the necessary information to identify the workspace.
5. If everything goes well, then you should see a page showing that Terraform Cloud is waiting for the configuration. Let’s configure it in the next exercise!
