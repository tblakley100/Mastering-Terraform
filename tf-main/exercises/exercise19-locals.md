# Working with Locals

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will be exploring the use of locals in Terraform. Locals provide a way to define a variable that can be reused within your module without needing to pass it in as an input variable. Through a series of steps, you will learn how to define locals, create a `common_tags` block, refactor an EC2 instance, create an S3 resource utilizing locals, and move the locals block to its own file. This exercise will enhance your understanding of locals and how they can be used to optimize your Terraform projects.

## Desired Outcome

If you wish to give it a shot before looking into the detailed step-by-step and the solution videos, here is an overview of what the created solution should deploy:

1. Define the following locals with sensible values: `project`, `project_owner`, `cost_center`, and `managed_by`.
2. Create a `common_tags` local object, which references some of the previous locals to create an object.
3. Refactor our EC2 instance to merge `local.common_tags` and `var.additional_tags` when setting its tags.
4. Deploy an S3 resource that also uses values from our locals in its configuration.
5. Move the locals block to its own file named `shared-locals.tf`.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Define the following locals in an existing file by using the `locals` block: `project`, `project_owner`, `cost_center`, and `managed_by`. Locals in Terraform are a way to define a variable that can be reused within your module without needing to pass it in as an input variable. You can place them in the `compute.tf` file to begin with.

    ```
    locals {
      project       = "08-input-vars-locals-outputs"
      project_owner = "terraform-course"
      cost_center   = "1234"
      managed_by    = "Terraform"
    }
    ```

2. Define a `common_tags` block that incorporates those values in an object-like structure.

    ```
    locals {
      common_tags = {
        project       = local.project
        project_owner = local.project_owner
        cost_center   = local.cost_center
        managed_by    = local.managed_by
      }
    }
    ```

3. Refactor the EC2 instance to merge the `local.common_tags` and the `var.additional_tags` when setting its tags.

    ```
    resource "aws_instance" "compute" {
      ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
      instance_type = var.ec2_instance_type

      root_block_device {
        delete_on_termination = true
        volume_size           = var.ec2_volume_config.size
        volume_type           = var.ec2_volume_config.type
      }

      tags = merge(local.common_tags, var.additional_tags)
    }
    ```

4. Create an S3 resource that also leverages some values from our locals in its configuration.

    ```
    resource "random_id" "project_bucket_suffix" {
      byte_length = 4
    }

    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "project_bucket" {
      bucket = "${local.project}-${random_id.project_bucket_suffix.hex}"

      tags = merge(local.common_tags, var.additional_tags)
    }
    ```

5. Move the locals block to its own file named `shared-locals.tf`. Notice that we donâ€™t need to explicitly import files in our Terraform projects.

## Congratulations on Completing the Exercise!

Great job on completing this exercise on using locals in Terraform. You've taken a significant step in enhancing your Terraform skills, gaining practical experience in defining locals, creating a `common_tags` block, refactoring an EC2 instance, and creating an S3 resource utilizing locals. Keep up the good work!
