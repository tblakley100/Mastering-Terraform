# Working with `tfvars`

## Introduction

In this exercise, we'll explore how to use `.tfvars` files in Terraform to manage and apply variable configurations. We'll be creating files that contain variable configurations and then loading them into our Terraform plan. This is a great way to manage different environments or stages in your infrastructure setup. The entire exercise should give you a hands-on experience of working with `terraform.tfvars` files and how they can be used effectively to manage configurations.

## Desired Outcome

If you wish to give it a shot before looking into the detailed step-by-step and the solution videos, here is an overview of what the created solution should deploy:

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file that contains configurations suitable for our defined variables.
2. Rename the file to `dev.terraform.tfvars`, and check what happens when running Terraform commands.
3. Create a new `prod.terraform.tfvars` file with different variable values should be created. We should be able to test loading this file into the Terraform plan and apply commands.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file with sensible values for the variables we have defined so far. Itâ€™s important that the file is called `terraform.tfvars`, since Terraform automatically looks for this file.

    ```
    ec2_instance_type = "t2.micro"

    ec2_volume_config = {
      size = 10
      type = "gp2"
    }

    additional_tags = {
      ValuesFrom = "terraform.tfvars"
    }
    ```

2. Run the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands to make sure Terraform is correctly loading the values from the `terraform.tfvars` file.
3. Now rename the file to `dev.terraform.tfvars` and re-run the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands. Is Terraform able to load the values? Terraform does not automatically load `.tfvars` files with other names, but you can pass the `.tfvars` file to the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands using the `-var-file=<filename>` option.
4. Create a new `prod.terraform.tfvars` file. Set different values for the variables, and test how we can load this file into the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands. Do not apply the configuration below, since it falls outside the free tier!

    ```
    ec2_instance_type = "t3.large"

    ec2_volume_config = {
      size = 10
      type = "gp3"
    }

    additional_tags = {
      ValuesFrom = "prod.terraform.tfvars"
    }
    ```

5. Make sure to destroy the resources after you complete all the steps!
