Welcome everyone! I'm very happy to see you around, and I hope this repository brings lots of value for those learning more about Terraform. Make sure to check the link above for a great discourse on the course in Udemy, where I not only provide theoretical explanations around all the concepts here, but also go in details through the entire coding of the examples in this repository.

Here are a few tips for you to best navigate the contents of this repository:
1. The `exercises` folder contains descriptions for all the implemented exercises. You can use it as a guide to try to implement them by yourself before following the solution recordings.
2. The `projects` folder contains six bigger projects that you can also tackle for an extra challenge ðŸ™‚ The solutions for these projects are implemented within their respective folders, **except for project 00, which is implemented inside of the folder `06-resources`**.
3. The other folders roughly mirror the structure of the course, but there are some course sections that span more than one folder.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
